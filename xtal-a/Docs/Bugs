Labels:
=======

 - need a way to localise the labels, better than the incrementing id we
   we currently have. Consider
   
	macro xxx
		done_?:
	
	macro yyy
			bcc done_?
		done_?:
		
	How does it know which label to use ?
	
	Suggestion:
		Internally rename labels to be <context>_<context-name>_<label-name>

		So the above would be:
			M_xxx_done
			M_yyy_done
		
		If we get functions later:
		
			F_fname_xxx
			
		Means you can't BCC/JSR out of a context, so maybe make a
		global context as well - start the label name with G_ or @ and it
		doesn't get the context munged.
		
		Need to rename labels in JMP, JSR and Bxx as well.
