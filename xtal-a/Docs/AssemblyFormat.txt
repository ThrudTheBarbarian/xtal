The assembler understands the following format:

- One statement per line, where a statement can be of the form, with
  optional parts in square brackets:

	[label:] opcode [arg] [arg] [; comment]

- Labels can end with : or . If they end with '.' they are implicitly
  prepended with the name of the last ":" label, thus allowing things like
  'loop.' to be re-used between major labels
  
- Labels can also end with _? in which case the ? part will automatically be
  given a monotonically incrementing value every time a label is seen. This
  is useful for jumps within macros, for example
  
- All standard 6502 mnemonics including addressing modes, eg:

	lda #4
	LDA $aa   		(or %xxxxxxxx for binary or @xxx for octal, or decimal)
	LDA $aa,X
	lda $aaaa		(as above with numbers)
	lda $aaaa , X
	lda $aaaa,Y
	lda ($aa, X)
	lda	($aa),Y

- It also understands higher-level macro-type instructions that correspond to
  the "registers" in zerop-page. Register memory is controlled thus
	
		$1C,$1D		: 65536 sets of 8K banks to function RAM at $6000 .. $7FFF
		$1E,$1F		: 65536 sets of 8K banks to data/fn RAM at $8000 .. $9FFF
		$80			: Page index for $C0..$CF  } compiler uses values here as
		$81			: Page index for $D0..$DF  } 8, 16, or 32-bit vars as
		$82			: Page index for $E0..$EF  } necessary
		$83			: Page index for $F0..$FF
		$84			: varargs count,
		$85			: varargs page index (vars start @0)
		$86			: cmd buffer
		$87			: fifo #1
		$88			: fifo #2
		$89..$8C	: overflow register, used in some arithmetic code
		$8D..$9F	: global vars (not swapped, 18 bytes)
		$A0..$AF	: 16 bytes of function-return-and-args. Not swapped
	  * $B0..$BF	: 16 bytes of function scratch-space [indexed by $1C,$1D].
								Not preserved over fn-calls
	  * $C0..$FF	: page-indexed variables [8,16,32-bit]
	
	  * means these locns are affected by zero-page indices ($80â€¦$83 or $1C,D)

- There are 16 registers names r0 through r15 which correspond to memory in
  the range $C0 to $FF.

- There are another 4 registers named f0 to f3, which are function input and
  output registers for transferring information to and from functions. These
  correspond to memory in the range $A0 to $AF.

- There are a final 4 registers named s0 to s3 which are scratch registers,
  basically just workspace for the current function. They are swapped out as
  the function is changed via the $1C,1D registers

- There is a command-buffer byte, which accepts a command (0..256) and whenever
  any byte is written to the fifo #1, that command will execute. If the command
  needs more than one byte, they are written to fifo #2 until there's only one
  left, and then write to fifo #1.
  
  This allows for fast zero-ing of memory ranges, or register moves etc.
  
	Eg: clear register 0. 5 clocks to clear 4 bytes, not 14
		LDA #ZEROZERO.4
		STA $87		
  
	Eg: clear register 2. 10(5) clocks to clear 4 bytes, not 14
		LDA #ZERO.4
		STA $87
		LDA #2
		STA $88
		
	Eg: clear registers 0-7. 15(10) clocks to clear 32 bytes, not 98
		LDA #ZERO_MULTIPLE.4
		STA $87
		LDA #7
		STA $89
		LDA #0
		STA $88
	
	Eg: copy register 1 to register 2, 15(10) clocks, not 20
		LDA #MOVE.4
		STA $87
		LDA #2
		STA $89
		LDA #1
		STA $88
		
- Operations can be marked as operating on 1, 2 or 4 bytes at a time. The space
  unused by the .2 and .1 formats is available for use by code. The used bytes
  are right-justified in the 4-bytes, so fn0.1 is in memory location $A3
  
- functions are expected to mark which registers are "clobbered" by their code
  and the assembler will emit protecting stack push/pops to handle that in the
  function call code automatically. [not yet implemented]

- Note that it's perfectly ok to use the register space for any use as long as
  it is marked as 'clobbered'
  
- The higher level macro-type instructions take the format
  
	move.4	r0		$aaaa
	move.2	$aaaa	$bbbb
	move.1	$aa		r1
	move.4	#$342	s0
	
	muls.4	r0		r1
	mulu.2	r2		r3
	
	divs.1	r4		r5
	divu.2	r6		r7
	
	adds.4	r8 		f0
	addu.2 	r9 		r10
	
	subs.4	r11		r12
	subu.2	r13		r14
	
	call function-name
	
- Floating point functionality is handled by replacing the last letter with f,
  so you end up with [not yet implemented]
  
		movf, mulf, divf, addf, subf, modf, itof, and ftoi
		
- If the register number is > 16, and the assembler is not currently using
  values within that page of registers, it will switch the context, emitting
  a write to a byte in $80 to $83 to update which set of registers will be
  written to

- The assembler understands memory-allocation directives such as

	label: .byte val,val,val,...
	label: .word val,val,...
	label: .long val,val,...			[not yet implemented]
	
  where a "val" can be a number in any format, or a string enclosed in ""
  to produce a series of bytes representing the ATASCII values, or a
  single character in '' to represent a single ATASCII value

- Similarly, the directive

	.addr symbol

  embeds the address associated with the symbol/label [not yet implemented]

- Extra code can be included with

	.include path/to/file
	
  where the set of places to look is passed to the assembler as a command
  line argument. Defaults (currently) to /opt/xtal/lib

- Macros can be defined with

		.macro name
			asm stmt
			asm stmt
			...
		.endmacro
	
	Any parameters in the macro can simply be named %1, %2, %3 etc. The
	first parameter must be %1, and the numbers must go up monotonically
	
	Macros will be expanded inline as if the assembly language was in
	place of them. Macros can be called recursively, and a set of them
	are provided in stdmacros.s in the library
	
	Arguments must be resolveable at the point of use on the 2nd pass
	
- Constants can be supplied from the commandline with -D <name>=<value>
  where there are no spaces between name and value
  
- Assembly can be conditional with .if (expression). If the expression
  evaluates to non-zero the "if" block will be included. .if blocks are
  terminated with .else or .endif and if the expression does evaluate to
  zero, anything between the optional .else and .endif will be assembled.
