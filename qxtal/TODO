To do:

  - Breakpoints list / management area (that's what the lower-middle part was intended to be)
  - Call-graph extraction and display
  - Interactive changes (edit assembly, reassemble, resimulate, show changes)
  - Syntax highlighting in the assembly / instruction stream
  - Parsing bytes into more-meaningful higher-level constructs (eg: these 4 bytes are a float of value...)
  - Use QFilesystemWatcher to auto-load the XEX if it changes on disk
  
Done:
  - The afore-mentioned breakpoints predicate editor
