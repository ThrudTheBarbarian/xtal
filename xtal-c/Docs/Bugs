List of known bugs


- If a series of maths ops overflows in the middle, the end result will appear
  to be wrong, so somethiing like:
  
		u8 x = 20 + 30 * 50 - 80 / 30

		... will overflow at the 30*50 stage.
	
		* Two possible ways to overcome this:
			
			- Introduce casts, so either the 30 or 50 could be (u16)(30)
			
			- Have an options keyword that sets the assumed size of types
			  for integers, at the moment we choose the smallest that fits
